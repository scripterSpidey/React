[REACT_HOOKS]

# The word React itself means for reaction when a change has happened.

# State: A state can be the current  value of a variable. It will change over time due to user interactions or by other methods. So the state of an item can change over time.

# Without React Hooks, react wont understand to change the virtual DOM. when a state of a component is changed without using react management system likes hooks or classes and we uses normal scripts, react will not know that the state has changed. So react will not trigger the rerender functionality

# state changes without react management system can also leed to bugs and issues
